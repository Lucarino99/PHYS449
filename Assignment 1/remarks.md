- Loading function should take arbitrary file (-1)
- Command of does not take correct inputs (-1)
- No implmentation of analytic solution (-3)
- Test your code with data, .in files, provided (-2)
- Gradient descent should be done with averaged gradient for entire dataset (-1)


## Other Remarks
- Script code should be under
```sh
if __name__ == "__main__":
```
- Try to use numpy elementwise and array operations
- Use function for gradient descent
- If code outputs to data folder please provide it
